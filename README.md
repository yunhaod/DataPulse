# DataPulse
Connecting to a microcontroller and recording its data through Bluetooth

The Arduino microcontroller must support BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), otherwise the arduino script would not work

Note: The python script will overwrite the existing csv file if ran more than once in a day. Increase or decrease the sleep duration for increment between each data collection
